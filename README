This is a wrapper for a collections of SQL scripts and Percona Toolkit scripts.

This program will use tools to analyse your redundant indexes on your local MySQL database server and output actionable commands to implement their removal.
Please note that it will only output text/sql/bash files. It will not run them. You will need to go over them and decide which commands you would like to run or not.

The tools you can run are:

[1] Duplicate key checker
[2] Duplicate key checker for the top 25 largest tables on your MySQL server.
(Caution, finding the top 25 largest tables can put your MySQL server under some temporary load)

[3] Duplicate key checker for the top 25 most used tables on your MySQL server.
(Caution, finding the top 25 most used tables can put your MySQL server under some temporary load)

[4] Duplicate key checker for the top 25 most used and largest tables on your MySQL server.
(Caution, finding the top 25 most used and largest tables can put your MySQL server under some temporary load)

[5] Unused Indexes (Requires USER_STATISTICS PATCH and for it to run a decent amount of time)
[6] Unused Indexes for the top 25 largest tables on your MySQL server.
(Caution, finding the top 25 largest tables can put your MySQL server under some temporary load)

[7] Unused Indexes for the top 25 most used tables on your MySQL server.
(Caution, finding the top 25 most used tables can put your MySQL server under some temporary load)

[8] Duplicate key checker for the top 25 most used and largest tables on your MySQL server.
(Caution, finding the top 25 most used and largest tables can put your MySQL server under some temporary load)

[9] Everything togther. Both pt-duplicate-key-checker and unused indexes fused together. (May result in two 'alter table's for same table)
Which of the following tools do you wish to run?[1-9 or (Q)uit]
